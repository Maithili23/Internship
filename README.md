# Internship

PROJECT 1

Project Topic : Indian Liver Patients

Done by: NAME:Maithili Rao B S , USN:4NM18CS088

Indian liver patients using Machine learning models

The main objective of this project is to predict whether the patients have liver disease or not so that affected patients can get needed treatment in time and rest are not unnecessarily treated.

The steps involved in the project are:

Exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

Data preprocessing

Building machine learning models using logistic regression and KNearestNeighbors

Evaluating the models

Final model creation and analysis outcome by preparing classification report and confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Final result of analysis: The accuracy obtained is
0.71 using logistic regression model
0.71 using KNN






PROJECT 2

Project Topic : Diabetes patients

Done by: NAME:Maithili Rao B S , USN:4NM18CS088

Diabetes patients using Machine learning models

The main objective of this project is to predict whether the patients is diabetic or not so that diabetic patients can be treated as needed.

The steps involved in the project are:

Exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

Data preprocessing

Building machine learning models using logistic regression and KNearestNeighbors

Evaluating the models

Final model creation and analysis outcome by preparing classification report and confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Final result of analysis: The accuracy obtained is
0.73 using logistic regression model
0.75 using KNN
